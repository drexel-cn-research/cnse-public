predicates:
  - name: contains               # Parent-child relationship (e.g., VPC contains Subnet or ECS Cluster contains Services)
  - name: depends-on             # Resource dependency relationships (e.g., Lambda depends on IAM Role)
  - name: connects-to            # Network or logical connectivity between resources (e.g., ENI connects-to Subnet)
  - name: exposes-to             # Resource exposure relationships (e.g., ALB exposes-to Internet)
  - name: exposed-by             # Inverse of exposes-to (e.g., Internet is exposed-by ALB)
  - name: routed-by              # Network routing mechanism (e.g., traffic is routed-by RouteTable)
  - name: routes-to              # Directional traffic flow (e.g., RouteTable routes-to InternetGateway)
  - name: secured-by             # Security control or boundary relationships (e.g., S3 Bucket secured-by IAM Policy)
  - name: controls-access-to     # Access control relationships (e.g., IAM Role controls-access-to Lambda)
  - name: delegates-to           # Permission delegation (e.g., IAM Role delegates-to IAM Policy)
  - name: stores-data-in         # Data persistence or storage relationships (e.g., Lambda stores-data-in DynamoDB)
  - name: reads-from             # Data consumption (e.g., Lambda reads-from SQS)
  - name: writes-to              # Data output relationships (e.g., Lambda writes-to CloudWatch Logs)
  - name: backed-up-by           # Backup or disaster recovery relationship (e.g., RDS backed-up-by Snapshot)
  - name: replicates-to          # Replication or high availability (e.g., S3 replicates-to another region)
  - name: runs-on                # Execution environment (e.g., Pod runs-on Node, Lambda runs-on Fargate)
  - name: triggers               # Event-based invocation (e.g., S3 triggers Lambda)
  - name: logs-to                # Logging or telemetry output (e.g., API Gateway logs-to CloudWatch Logs)
  - name: monitors               # Observability and metrics relationships (e.g., CloudWatch monitors EC2)
  - name: managed-by             # Orchestration or lifecycle control (e.g., NodeGroup managed-by EKS Cluster)
  - name: scheduled-on           # Scheduling or placement relationship (e.g., CronJob scheduled-on Node)
  - name: targets                # Selection or targeting (e.g., Security Group targets EC2 Instances)
  - name: owned-by               # Ownership or account-level association (e.g., Resource owned-by AWS Account)
  - name: mounts                 # Volume or configuration mounting (e.g., Pod mounts ConfigMap or EBS Volume)
