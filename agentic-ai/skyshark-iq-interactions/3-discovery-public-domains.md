# PUBLIC DOMAINS SERVING RESOURCES

Based on the provided data, I've identified several public domains that are being used to serve resources across the AWS environment. These domains are exposed to the internet and are configured through Route53 hosted zones and record sets.

## PRIMARY DOMAINS

1. jointangerine.com
   - Hosted zone ID: Z942449GNH86H5NRJB
   - Public zone (PrivateZone: false)
   - Contains 3 resource record sets

2. prod.jointangerine.com
   - Hosted zone ID: Z099187TU1TNBHDS
   - Public zone (PrivateZone: false)
   - Contains 27 resource record sets
   - Managed by Terraform

3. pieadblock.com
   - Hosted zone ID: Z984279U8H1QGDG
   - Public zone (PrivateZone: false)
   - Contains 2 resource record sets
   - Created by Route53 Registrar

4. fruits-pop.com
   - Hosted zone ID: Z99358237A1FX1
   - Public zone (PrivateZone: false)
   - Contains 2 resource record sets
   - Created by Route53 Registrar

5. trytangerine.me
   - Hosted zone ID: Z905195CFG9J8
   - Public zone (PrivateZone: false)
   - Contains 2 resource record sets

## SUBDOMAINS ACTIVELY SERVING RESOURCES

1. site.jointangerine.com
   - Type: CNAME
   - Points to: proxy-ssl.flowstream.com
   - Used for hosting website content via flowstream

2. cdn.prod.jointangerine.com
   - Type: CNAME
   - Points to: c234040a8u.cloudfront.net
   - Used for content delivery via CloudFront

3. api.prod.jointangerine.com
   - Type: CNAME
   - Points to: k8s-prod-tangerineapi-cb95a-666194.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com
   - Used for API services via an ELB in us-east-2

4. data.prod.jointangerine.com
   - Has ACM validation record (_a609b3066a942c9.data.prod.jointangerine.com)
   - Likely serving data-related resources

## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

1. All hosted zones are public (PrivateZone: false), meaning their records are resolvable from the public internet.

2. Several domains have ACM validation records, indicating they're using SSL/TLS certificates for secure HTTPS connections, which is a security best practice.

3. The CloudFront distributions (cq340a8u.cloudfront.net and others) provide an additional security layer by offering edge protection and caching.

4. The API endpoint (api.prod.jointangerine.com) is exposed via an ELB, which should be properly configured with security groups to restrict access.

5. No DNSSEC configuration was observed in the provided data, which would be a recommended security enhancement for DNS integrity protection.

6. The prod.jointangerine.com zone is managed by Terraform, indicating infrastructure-as-code practices which can help maintain consistent security configurations.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Implement DNSSEC for all public domains to prevent DNS spoofing attacks.

2. Ensure all public endpoints use valid SSL/TLS certificates and enforce HTTPS.

3. Regularly audit DNS records to remove any that are no longer needed.

4. Consider using Route53 health checks for critical endpoints to improve reliability.

5. Implement proper WAF rules for CloudFront distributions to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

6. Review TTL values for DNS records - security-critical records should have lower TTLs to allow faster updates if needed.

7. Consider using private hosted zones for internal-only resources to reduce attack surface.
